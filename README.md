# Rosalind-Problems
This repository contains my solutions for bioinformatics problems from the 'Bioinformatics Stronghold', 'Bioinformatics Armory', and 'Algorithmic Heights' problem sets on [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). 
Solutions are either formatted to work with example problem or with dataset.
