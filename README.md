# Rosalind-Problems
This repository contains my solutions for bioinformatics problems from the 'Bioinformatics Stronghold' on Rosalind. 
Solutions are either formatted to work with example problem, or with dataset.

1. Counting DNA Nucleotides
2. Transcribing DNA into RNA
3. Complementing a Strand of DNA
4. Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
5. Computing GC Content
6. Counting Point Mutations
7. Mendel's First Law
8. Translating RNA into Protein
9. Finding a Motif in DNA


| ID   | Title   | Description   |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| DNA  | Counting DNA Nucleotides | Counting the number of each nucleotide in a string of DNA
| RNA | Transcribing DNA into RNA | Given a DNA string, transcribe it into the corresponding RNA string
| REVC | Complementing a Strand of DNA | Given a DNA string, output the reverse complement
| FIB | Rabbits and Recurrence Relations | Total number of rabbits in population after n months, starting with 1 pair producing litter of k pairs
| GC | Computing GC Content | Comparing different GC strings, output string ID with highest GC content
| HAMM | Counting Point Mutations | Determine the Hamming distance between two strings
| IPRB | Mendel's First Law | Given k, m, n representing genotype, output probability mating organisms will have dominant allele
| PROT | Translating rna Into Protein | Output protein string encoded by mRNA string
| SUBS | Finding a Motif in DNA | Given two strings, return locations of all substring in main string
