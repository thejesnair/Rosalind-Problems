# Rosalind-Problems
This repository contains my solutions for bioinformatics problems from the 'Bioinformatics Stronghold' on Rosalind. 
Solutions are either formatted to work with example problem, or with dataset.

| ID   | Title   | Description   |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| DNA  | [Counting DNA Nucleotides](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Counting%20DNA%20Nucleotides) | Counting the number of each nucleotide in a string of DNA
| RNA | [Transcribing DNA into RNA](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Transcribing%20DNA%20into%20RNA) | Given a DNA string, transcribe it into the corresponding RNA string
| REVC | [Complementing a Strand of DNA](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Complementing%20Strand%20of%20DNA) | Given a DNA string, output the reverse complement
| FIB | [Rabbits and Recurrence Relations](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Rabbits%20and%20Recurrence%20Relations) | Total number of rabbits in population after n months, starting with 1 pair producing litter of k pairs
| GC | [Computing GC Content](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Computing%20GC%20Content) | Comparing different GC strings, output string ID with highest GC content
| HAMM | [Counting Point Mutations](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Counting%20Point%20Mutations) | Determine the Hamming distance between two strings
| IPRB | [Mendel's First Law](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Mendel's%20First%20Law) | Given k, m, n representing genotype, output probability mating organisms will have dominant allele
| PROT | [Translating RNA into Protein](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Translating%20RNA%20into%20Protein) | Output protein string encoded by mRNA string
| SUBS | [Finding a Motif in DNA](https://github.com/thejesnair/Rosalind-Problems/blob/main/Finding%20a%20Motif%20in%20DNA) | Given two strings, return locations of all substring in main string
